ESTIMATE: 16 Hours

Date	Time Started 	Time Spent
5/1 	2:15 			2:00

Wrote command-line detection/parsing,
and code to build trie from stdin.

5/1  	5:30 			1:30

Wrote code to do the trie traversal. To
do: boggle graph search.

5/2 	12:20  			1:15

Fininshed code for graph search and -c flag
 - need to write -t flag code. 

5/2 	1:05			0:45

Wrote -t flag, passes public test script.
Debugged and cleaned up code. Wrote statement
of difficulties.

TOTAL: 5:30

I worked alone for this pset. 

Statement of major difficulties:
Fortunately, I didn't really hit any major stumbling blocks
in the pset - I definitely feel like my efficiency in doing
problems has increased a lot since the start of the year. 
As per usual, I still made a minor mistake in forgetting to
clear the getline buffer... which cost me about 20% of the
total time I spent working. The graph search algorithm 
seemed daunting at first, but I was able to wrap my head
around it after 20 minutes or so of pseudocode. Overall,
not as challenging as some of the mid-semester psets, but
definitely requiring some thought for how to jointly work
with the trie and boggle board.
